# Privacy Policy for Qode
_Last updated: 11.12.2025_

Qode (“the App”) is developed and operated by **Ybyraiym Aktanberdi** (“Developer”, “we”, “us”).  
By using Qode, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

---

## 1. Developer Information
**Data Controller:**  
Ybyraiym Aktanberdi  
Email: **qodeinhq@gmail.com**

Qode is an independently developed application and is not operated by a registered legal entity.

---

## 2. Data We Collect
We collect only the data required to provide core functionality, maintain stability, and understand how the App is used.

### 2.1. Account Information (Firebase Authentication)
When you sign in with Google, we collect:
- Email address  
- Google user ID (UID)  
- Profile image URL (if available)

This is required to identify authors of submitted content and prevent impersonation.

### 2.2. User-Generated Content (UGC)
Stored in Firebase Firestore and Firebase Storage:
- Promocodes and posts submitted by users  
- Titles, descriptions, service names  
- Uploaded images  
- Voting actions (upvote/downvote)  
- Metadata such as post count and promo count  
- Timestamps (created/updated)

All UGC published in the App is publicly visible.

### 2.3. Analytics Data (Firebase Analytics)
We use Firebase Analytics to understand app usage and improve user experience.

Data collected may include:
- Screen views  
- Button taps  
- Session duration  
- Feature usage  
- Device information such as model, OS version, and app version

Firebase Analytics is configured **without Advertising ID collection**.  
No behavioral profiling or ad personalization is performed.

### 2.4. Crash and Performance Data (Firebase Crashlytics)
Crashlytics may collect:
- Device model  
- OS version  
- App version  
- Crash logs and stack traces  
- Temporary IP address (routing purposes only)

This data is used solely for debugging and stability improvements.

### 2.5. Search Index Data (Algolia)
Algolia indexes **public** content to enable efficient search:
- Promocode text  
- Service names  
- Public UGC fields

Algolia does *not* receive personal identifiers such as email or UID.

---

## 3. Advertising & Promotional Content
The App displays **non-personalized promotional banners**.

- Banners may promote Qode features or third-party brands.  
- No tracking or personalization is used.  
- No advertising networks (e.g., AdMob) are integrated.

Because banners are clearly promotional, the App may be labeled **“Contains ads”** on Google Play.

---

## 4. How We Use Data
Data is used to:
- Authenticate users  
- Support content submission and management  
- Provide search functionality  
- Diagnose crashes and performance issues  
- Analyze usage patterns to improve features  
- Display non-personalized promotional banners  
- Prevent abuse and maintain security

We do not sell or rent personal data.

---

## 5. Permissions
### Current Permissions
- **INTERNET** — Required for core functionality  
- **POST_NOTIFICATIONS** — Optional notifications

### Future Permissions (not currently active)
The App does not currently request:
- `CAMERA`  
- `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`  
- `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`

These may be added in future versions to support image uploads.  
Permissions will be activated only after explicit user action, and this policy will be updated accordingly.

---

## 6. Data Sharing
We share data only with essential service providers:
- Google Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Analytics, Crashlytics)  
- Algolia (search indexing of public data)

No personal information is shared with advertisers or third-party marketing partners.

---

## 7. Data Retention
We retain:
- Account data until the user deletes their account (feature coming soon)  
- User-generated content until removed by the user or moderated  
- Crash logs based on Firebase’s retention policy

---

## 8. Account Deletion
Account deletion is not yet available and will be introduced in a future update.

When available, deleting your account will remove:
- Authentication data  
- Personal identifiers  
- Non-essential metadata

User-generated content may remain unless removed before account deletion.

---

## 9. Children’s Privacy
Qode does not target children under 13.  
We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.  
If such data is discovered, it will be deleted.

---

## 10. App Access Rules
- Browsing public content: no login required  
- Posting, voting, uploading images: login required  
- No special reviewer credentials needed  
- No hidden or restricted sections

---

## 11. Security
We rely on Firebase’s infrastructure for secure data handling:
- Encrypted HTTPS  
- Server-enforced Firestore and Storage rules  
- Access control via Firebase Authentication

Users must protect their Google account credentials.

---

## 12. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy as needed.  
Updates will always be published at:

**https://github.com/aqtanb/qode/blob/main/PRIVACY_POLICY.md**

Continued use of the App after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
