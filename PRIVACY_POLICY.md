# Privacy Policy
Qode

## Personal Data
Qode uses Google Firebase services (Authentication and Firestore) to provide core functionality. This means your data (such as login credentials and user-generated content) is stored securely on Google’s servers.

The developer of Qode does not store your personal data outside of Firebase, and does not sell your data to third parties.

## Analytics
Qode uses analytics tools to understand app usage and improve the user experience. These analytics may collect information such as device type, app usage patterns, and performance data.

## Advertising
Qode does not serve ads.

## Internet Access
Qode requires Internet access to function. All communication is between the app and Google’s servers.

## Backups
Qode does not create device-level backups. Your data is stored online in Firebase.

## Third Parties
Since Qode is distributed through Google Play and uses Firebase, Google may collect information as described in their own Privacy Policy.

## Children’s Privacy
Qode is not directed to children under 13. If you are under 13, you should not use this app without parental consent.
