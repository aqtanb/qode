User Content includes Promocodes, Posts, submitted images, comments (if added later), and user interactions (such as upvotes and downvotes).

* You are solely responsible for the content you post.
* Do not submit any content that is illegal, defamatory, misleading, infringing on third-party rights (including copyright), or intended as spam.
* **Grant of License:** By submitting content, you grant Qode (Ybyraiym Aktanberdi) a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, and display that content solely for the purpose of operating, improving, and promoting the Service.

### C. Developer Responsibility
* The developer reserves the right to review, remove, or block any content or accounts that violate these rules.

When you delete your account, all your content (posts, promocodes, images) will be permanently removed from the App.

## 4. Intellectual Property Rights (IP)
The app (including its code, design, logo, database structure, and all content provided by the developer) is and will remain the exclusive property of **Ybyraiym Aktanberdi**. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive license to use Qode strictly according to these Terms.

## 5. Prohibited Uses

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranties and Liability
### A. Service Provision
Qode is provided **“as is”** and **“as available.”** The developer makes no warranties, expressed or implied, regarding the service's continuous availability, reliability, or freedom from errors.

### B. Limitation of Liability
The developer is not responsible for any direct, indirect, or consequential damages resulting from your use or inability to use Qode, including damages arising from reliance on user-submitted content or service interruptions.

### C. Indemnification
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the developer (Ybyraiym Aktanberdi) from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, and expenses arising from your violation of these Terms or your posting of content that violates the rights of any third party.

## 7. Content Moderation and Reporting

By submitting a report, you agree that:
* Reports should be made in good faith
* False or malicious reports may result in account suspension
* The developer has final discretion on moderation decisions

### B. User Blocking
Users may block other users to hide their content. Blocking is user-controlled and does not require developer intervention. Blocked users' content will be completely hidden from the blocker.

## 8. Sponsored Content and Affiliate Links
Some content displayed within Qode, including banners or posts in the dedicated `banners` collection, may be sponsored or the result of partnerships. Such content will be clearly marked as sponsored where possible.

**Affiliate Links:**
The App may include affiliate links to third-party services in the future. These links will be clearly disclosed. Clicking such links may result in the developer receiving a commission, at no additional cost to you.

## 9. Changes to Terms
The developer reserves the right to update or modify these Terms of Service at any time. We will notify you of significant changes. Continued use of Qode after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.
